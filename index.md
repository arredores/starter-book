# Front Page

This is the front page of your book. It can be reached by clicking the first link in the table of contents or by clicking the title of the book (on any page). This file must be named `index.md`.

The first thing at the beginning of each page (including the front page) should be a heading (represented in markdown by `# Title`). This heading will be used in the table of contents and the page title (on the browser tab). If you do not have a heading on the page, we will use the filename to generate this information.
